summary: "Implemented the firmware for the TI Sensortag that incorporates the Madgwick Orientation Filter to generate quaternions for sitting posture prediction."

# Introduction
The project involves the creation of a full-stack IOT solution to an existing and prevalent societal issue; sitting postures of working adults in front of the computer leading to unhealthy curvatures forced upon the spine.

# Contributions
1. Conducted research on Quaternions and the Madgwick Orientation Filter for a more efficient representation of the position of the spine in 3D space.
1. Implemented an efficient version of the Madgwick Orientation Filter on the sensortag firmware, by reducing precision to reduce packet size under delicate balance of sufficient accuracy over speed.
1. Created a new BLE characteristic and service from scratch to serve quaternion data generated on the device's motion processing unit.
1. Programmed the BLE data gateway to process BLE data using AsyncIO library.

# Reflections
1. Math is related to science!? Just kidding about the surprise. The true learning is that an acute understanding of the right math can simplify a problem to a solvable one.
