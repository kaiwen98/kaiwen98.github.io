# Introduction
Programmed firmware for a remote-control robot using `Keil v5 IDE` and the CMSIS-RTOS2 library. Implemented a multi-threaded program with synchronisation using message queues and thread flags.

# Contributions
1. Programmed a majority of the firmware, including thread synchronisation, interfacing with ultrasonic sensors, LED arrays, motor control and self-driving mode.
1. Experimented with memory allocation and low-level device firmware so as to allow clean implementation of library functions from bare-metal code.
1. Influenced my team to use Lithium Ion batteries, which provided a good supply of current to allow the motors to run at higher PWM frequency.

# Reflection
* Battery is everything.
* It is better to solder your circuitory so that electrical contacts do not come loose.
