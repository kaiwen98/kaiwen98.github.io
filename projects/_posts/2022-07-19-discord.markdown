# Introduction
[Source Code](https://github.com/kaiwen98/palettebot)
<br>
Created a Discord Bot to share my workload as the severely overworked secretary and chairperson of the Art division of the club.

# Contributions

- Developed a Discord Bot to **automate administrative tasks** that fall under my purview as the Productions Director in NUS
Comic and Animation Society.
- The bot features tracking of birth dates, automated extraction of artworks from the Discord Channel, as well as running a
month-long drawing activity **(Digitised Inktober)** with an elaborate point system.
- **Technical Skills**: Discord API, Google Drive API, Google Sheet API, Numpy and Pandas.

# Reflection
* There is a need to practice proper security protocols in sensitive projects, including ones that handle the use of API credentials, personal information and access to Google accounts. This project taught me to practice vigilance and be sensitive to potential caveats during the development process.
