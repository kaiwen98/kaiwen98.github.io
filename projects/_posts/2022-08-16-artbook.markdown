# Introduction
[Source Code](https://github.com/kaiwen98/artbook_generator)
<br>
Modernised the painful process of compiling artbook pages on Photoshop to a powerful Python script. The program extracts image data from responses towards a Google Form, checks against registration details, and programmatically compiles all entries into artbooks for online distribution.

# Contributions
- Wrote the entire program from scratch
- **Technical Skills**: Win32ComAPI with Photoshop, Python Image Library, Pandas, GSpread and PyDrive.



# Reflections
I was shocked that Photoshop can be scripted from a Python codebase. It turned out to be extremely convenient for this use case.
