# Introduction

The project requirement is to program firmware for TI SensorTags such that each sensor is able to detect another sensor that is proximate to itself within a certain period of time. If the sensor fulfills said condition, both sensors are said to be in close contact.

# Contributions

![Cooja](/assets/images/cs4222_1.jpg)

1. Contributed to the implementation of the Quorum-Based Discovery Algorithm, based on the following [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1019261).
1. Worked with the Contiki OS to program the TI Sensortags, using protothreads and RTimers to implement a power-efficient state machine.
1. Used Cooja to simulate network traffic so that the optimal scan period and algorithm can be derived in view of battery life, duty cycle and reliability. 

# Reflection
* Reliability is the cornerstone of network devices!
* Naming of variables and commenting helps to communicate your algorithms smoothly, especially with other developers!
