# Introduction
[Source Code](https://github.com/kaiwen98/spacey)
<br>
Designed and developed a Seat Occupancy System in hawker centres as part of the NUS Orbital Program, complete with a working sensor network, Telegram Bot and a Desktop Map Editor. Inspired by lunch under social distancing measures during the COVID Pandemic.

# Contributions
- Implemented a **cheap, low power and reliable BLE sensor network**, comprising of **ESP32 sensor motes** and implementing star topology for transmission of seat occupancy data.
- Developed a desktop program to facilitate the conversion of seat occupancy data to a legible JPEG file for viewing and monitoring. Allows restaurant owners to upload their floor plan to launch to the backend for live occupancy updates.
- **Technical Skills**: Telegram bot Python Library, C++, Python, Redis, Tkinter and Inno Setup Scripting Language. Knowledge with ESP32, battery design and Wireless Sensor Networks were also applied.

# Reflections
This project sparked my interests in the Internet of Things. It also first proved to me that the world is full of problems that are waiting to be solved; we just need to open our eyes and get ready to take action!
